          <p>Our livestock industry contributes a lot to greenhouse gases.
              Scientists have discovered that adding seaweed to cattle feed
              reduces the amount of methane that cows produce by a lot. A
              particular variety of seaweed is very good at doing this.</p>

          <h3>The Issue</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>The issue as we see it is two-fold:
            <ol>
              <li>In the words of Sarah Brenholt, campaign manager of Stronger America 
              Through Seafood, "â€œWe lag behind the rest of the world in aquaculture 
              production, one of the reasons for that is the lack of a clear, 
              predictable framework" (3). For many states, the framework behind getting 
              licenses and permits for aquaculture is confusing, vague, or not made 
              with seaweed farming in mind.</li>
              <li>With seaweed farming being a relatively small and new industry in 
              the United States, the information needed to start an algaculture 
              business or research project is limited and very dependent upon a variety 
              of factors. This gap of information is deterring potential seaweed farmers 
              and making the industry inaccessible to all but those who already have 
              connections in the industry in other countries.</li>
            </ol>

          <h3>Our Response</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>We cannot wait the uncertain amount of time it would take for seaweed farming 
            to become more widely accessible to the American public. With the substantial 
            amount of benefits that harvesting seaweed brings, including our focus on 
            methane reduction in cows, it would be highly beneficial to develop a database 
            that potential algaculturists could use to easily find more information and 
            resources on the subject.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we aimed to create a prototype of this database (or at least a 
            limited version of it) that would demonstrate our vision of sustainable 
            technology to the UGA Hack team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <p>Were we to continue this project further than this weekend, we would like to better
          understand the MERN stack so that we could do a full database integration of the 50 states,
          as well as more permit information based on if a potential algaculturist would prefer
          aquaponics.</p>
